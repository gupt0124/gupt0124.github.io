    <p>Hey everyone, I am <em>Harshmit  gupta</em>, as you know one of your classmates but some of you do not know much about me as we have not talked much even the class. So, now i am going to introduce my self so that it would become easier for all of us to become familier with one another. I came from <em>India</em> last month to study here as the level of education is not as efficient as it is here. I have completed my 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> class from <abbr title="Dayanand Anglo Vedic">DAV</abbr> school which is in Jagraon.</p>
    <p>My birth place is Jagraon which is a town in <strong>Punjab</strong> state. Basically, when i opted for this course, i do not have much interest in this but our respected well educated professor <em><strong>Mr. Robert Kingsbury</strong> </em> method of teaching has grown my interest in this and from the past two weeks, i love to do this and at the end of the class, i am always keen waiting for the next week to come so that i can learn new things from my professor. </p>
